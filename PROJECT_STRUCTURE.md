# Neural Network Project Structure

This project is organized into modular components for easy reuse and development of different neural network applications.

## Folder Organization

### üìÅ `foundational_brain/`

The core neural network implementation that can be used as a foundation for any pattern recognition task.

**Contents:**

- `NeuralNet.py` - The foundational neural network with forward/backpropagation
- `README.md` - Documentation for the foundational network
- `.gitignore` - Version control configuration

**Use this when:** You want to build a new neural network application from scratch.

### üìÅ `medical_diagnosis_model/`

A complete medical diagnosis system built on top of the foundational neural network.

**Contents:**

- All medical diagnosis source files (20+ files)
- Training architecture diagram
- Complete documentation
- Demo scripts
- Requirements file

**Use this when:** You want to run or extend the medical diagnosis system.

## How to Use

### For New Projects

1. Copy the `foundational_brain` folder
2. Rename it to your project (e.g., `image_recognition_model`)
3. Import and extend the base neural network:
   ```python
   from NeuralNet import initialize_network, train_network
   ```

### For Medical Diagnosis

1. Navigate to `medical_diagnosis_model/`
2. Create virtual environment and install dependencies
3. Run `python enhanced_medical_system.py`

## Moving Between Projects

Each folder is self-contained with all necessary dependencies:

```bash
# Work on medical diagnosis
cd medical_diagnosis_model/
python enhanced_medical_system.py

# Start a new project
cp -r foundational_brain/ my_new_model/
cd my_new_model/
# Begin development...
```

## Architecture Overview

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ foundational_brain/          # Core neural network
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ medical_diagnosis_model/     # Medical application
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ future_model/               # Your next project
```

This modular structure allows you to:

- Keep models separate and organized
- Reuse the foundational code
- Develop multiple applications in parallel
- Easily share specific models without unnecessary files
